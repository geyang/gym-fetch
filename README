Extended Taskset for the Fetch Robot
====================================

|PyPI version|

Installation
------------

you can do:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install gym-fetch

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and install under development
mode:

::

   git clone <this repo>
   cd <this repo>
   pip install -e .

Environments
------------

We extend existing Fetch environments from gym, with 7 new manipulation
tasks. The ``gym.Fetch`` environment are much better engineered than the
sawyer environments that ``metaworld`` uses. They are faster to
initialize, and have a small (50 step) maximum episode length, making
these environments faster to train on.

   We might or might not need to extend the ``max_episode_steps`` on
   more complex tasks.

For Up-To-Date Environments
---------------------------

All documentations are maintained in the `https://github.com/geyang/gym_fetch/blob/master/specs <specs>`__ folder,
where each task set is one markdown file.

-  **original gym fetch tasks**:
   `https://github.com/geyang/gym_fetch/blob/master/specs/gym_fetch.md <https://github.com/geyang/gym_fetch/blob/master/specs/gym_fetch.md>`__
-  **``bin`` tasks**: `https://github.com/geyang/gym_fetch/blob/master/specs/bin.md <https://github.com/geyang/gym_fetch/blob/master/specs/bin.md>`__
-  **``bin_debug`` tasks**: `https://github.com/geyang/gym_fetch/blob/master/specs/bin_debug.md <https://github.com/geyang/gym_fetch/blob/master/specs/bin.md>`__
-  **``box`` tasks**: `https://github.com/geyang/gym_fetch/blob/master/specs/box.md <https://github.com/geyang/gym_fetch/blob/master/specs/box.md>`__
-  **``drawer`` tasks**: `https://github.com/geyang/gym_fetch/blob/master/specs/drawer.md <https://github.com/geyang/gym_fetch/blob/master/specs/drawer.md>`__

The multi-task environments are still under development. They are
located under

Primitive Single Task Environments
==================================

The tasks involve a single primitive action such as open/closing a box,
or a drawer. They do not additionally involve placing an object into the
opened drawer or box. We include bin picking and placing because the bin
does not require additional actions to open.

================== =================== =========== ============

================== =================== =========== ============

Intermediate Task
=================

These tasks additionally require placing the object inside an open
drawer or box. We include the ``Bin-picking`` environment for
completeness.

================== =================== =========== ============

Multi-task Environments
=======================

These environments require significantly more memory due to the
increasing complexity of contact detection and collision dynamics. These
are also slower to run.
