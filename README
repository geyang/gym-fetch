``gym-Sawyer``, a Sawyer plugin for OpenAI Gym
==============================================

Current release at ``v0.1.0``.

Installation
------------

The ``gym-sawyer`` package name is currently being squatted `(issue
PEP541) <https://github.com/pypa/pypi-support/issues/423>`__ so I went
for the shorter ``sawyer`` module name instead.

To install:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install sawyer

or

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/geyang/gym-sawyer

Usage Example
-------------

Please refer to the `specs <https://github.com/geyang/gym_sawyer/blob/master/specs>`__ folder for detailed usage
examples. These examples and notes are generated programmatically as
part of the test suite.

.. code-block:: python

   import gym

   env = gym.make("sawyer:PickPlace-v0", width=84, height=84, cam_id=-1)

   env.render("notebook")
